# What is SimpleMMO?
<b>SimpleMMO</b> is a very simple, and casual MMORPG that has the aim to revive the text based game genre. For too long now, the text based RPG game genre has slowly been fading away into obscurity while the clunky text based graphical games with too many unnecessary and complicated visuals have been rising dramatically. 

<b>SimpleMMO</b>'s aim is to go back to the roots of text based games and provide a seamless, enjoyable and visually appealing experience the player without providing a clunky UI and a massive file size.

All you need to do is take a step with a simple click of a button and away you go! Traverse the world with strange, funny, serious, and downright ridiculous adventure texts with every step that you take.
