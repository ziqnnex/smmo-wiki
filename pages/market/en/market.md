<h1> Market | Player Market </h1> 

The player market exists so players can sell their items to other players. To access the player market, go to Town. 


<h1> Market | Adding An Item To The Player Market </h1> 

Go to your inventory, find the item you want to add to the market. Select that Item and choose the 'List on Market' option.
After tapping List on Market you can specify the quantity and what amount of money you want for your item. There is no confirmation when pressing the "Sell Item" button, so be careful not to press it by accident!



Note:
- There is a 3.5% fee for selling items on the Market. The 3.5% fee is automatically collected after your item(s) were sold. 
- You cannot sell Keys (any type) or Diamond Shards on the Market.
- You may either withdraw money from your Bank to be able to buy items, or choose to use funds directly from your Bank for a fee of 2.5% of the total item price when buying from the Player Market.
