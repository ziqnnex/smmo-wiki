Hello, fellow adventurers! Here are a few tips on how to start playing this game.

# How should I start?
- You can earn experience by Traveling, doing Quests, Jobs, Tasks, and fighting Battles!
- In the beginning, you should focus on levelling up Dexterity to increase the success rate of Quests!
- It is best not to Gamble, as you can, and will lose the little gold you have in the beginning. You can keep your gold safe from your addiction in the Bank!
- If you have any problems with being attacked by other players, you can turn on Safe Mode. (Though this only happens at level 5+ and if your health is above 50%).
  - Permanent safe mode will be automatically activated upon reaching level 200, you will be able to turn it off once for free.
- It is free to heal 3 times per day in Folen's Tent. In addition, you can regen HP by Food or simply over time at a rate of 5% HP per 5 minutes.
- Do not beg in Chat for gold or items. It does not work, and frequently results in negative reputation. Not only that, but it's against the rules!
- Try not to spend your gold on items in the Player Market at a low level, as you will quickly find out that they are inferior to higher-level items that you find later on for free.
- BANK YOUR EXCESS GOLD. This will prevent you from losing a chunk of it if you are killed by another player.
- Select a job as soon as possible. You get permanent stat bonuses from your current job and rank within it. See Jobs for more information.
- A good way to earn experience is by always using your energy in the Battle Arena and doing Quests with your quest points.
- If you are idling, calculate the time it takes to regenerate both energy and quest points (50 Minutes if you haven't bought any more with Diamonds), and set your Jobs to that time and turn push notifications on so you are alerted when your job is complete. This will help you be as efficient as you can be whilst idling.
