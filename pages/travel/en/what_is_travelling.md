Travel |  What is Travelling? 

Travelling, also known as stepping is one of the forefront features of the game. By clicking on the "Take A Step" button, players are able to read travel texts and earn; gold, experience points, items and also fight NPCs without the use of energy points.


Travel | The Travel Screen

When a player visits the Travel Screen they are presented with; their icon and level, the amount of gold they are carrying, a travel text that says "The start of your adventure...
You emerge from the hole that you call your home and set off on your adventure.", a "Take a Step" button, 3 coloured icons; green for experience rate, orange for gold rate, and blue for item rarity rate. The percentage changes depending whether the player is in a guild, the amount of steppers at the time, and whether the orphange boost has been activated or not. 

Clicking the "3 Dots" on the Travel screen a player is able to; view which town/location they are currently stepping at, change their travel location, view stepping parties, view stats on current guild and global steppers, use a binded item, and report a travel text.


Travel | Travel Text 

Travel texts are developer-approved text snippets, typically being any variety of different adventurous situations, inside jokes, pop culture references, or a mix of the three. There is also a short delay after pressing the step button, which is determined entirely by the character length of the travel text currently displayed. Players are not able to submit Travel Texts anymore.


Travel | Stepping Parties 

Step with your fellow Plebeians and Simpletopians! Players are now able to step with other players by creating or joining a stepping party! A maximum of 4 players can be in a party. The party's leader can invite players from their friends list or, make the party public so that anybody is able to join their party. Players can find the "Parties Page" through clicking the 3 dots on the Travel Screen and clicking "View Parties". In doing so, a list of public parties or friends parties is shown. Benefits of joining a party is extra experience and gold when simultaneously stepping with another party member, the amount of both scales depending on your own level.
