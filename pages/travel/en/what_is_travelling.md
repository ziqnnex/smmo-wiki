Travel |  What is Travelling? 

Travelling, also known as stepping is one of the forefront features of the game. By clicking on the "Take A Step" button, players are able to read travel texts and earn; gold, experience points, items and also fight NPCs without the use of energy points.


Travel | The Travel Screen

When a player visits the Travel Screen they are presented with; their icon and level, the amount of gold they are carrying, a travel text that says "The start of your adventure...
You emerge from the hole that you call your home and set off on your adventure.", a "Take a Step" button, 3 coloured icons; green for experience rate, orange for gold rate, and blue for item rarity rate. The percentage changes depending whether the player is in a guild, the amount of steppers at the time, and whether the orphange boost has been activated or not. 

Clicking the "3 Dots" on the Travel screen a player is able to; view which town/location they are currently stepping at, change their travel location, view stepping parties, view stats on current guild and global steppers, use a binded item, and report a travel text.


Travel | Travel Text 

Travel texts are developer-approved text snippets, typically being any variety of different adventurous situations, inside jokes, pop culture references, or a mix of the three. There is also a short delay after pressing the step button, which is determined entirely by the character length of the travel text currently displayed. Players are not able to submit Travel Texts anymore.
