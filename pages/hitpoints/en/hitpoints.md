<h1> Hitpoints | Health </h1>

Hitpoints (also known as "HP") represent the player's health.

If a player has 0 hitpoints, they can no longer travel or fight. HP naturally regenerates at 5% per 5 minutes and 10% per 5 minutes if you are a pleb. A player starts with 50 HP and it increases by 5 each level.

HP at any level can be found using the equation:

HP = 5(n-1)+50 where n is your level. For example, at level 69, HP = 5(69-1)+50 = 390

<h1> Hitpoints | Death </h1>

If the player's HP drops to 0, their ability to Travel will not be available until they gain at least one HP back.

A player's HP can be reduced by fighting a NPC in the Battle Arena, attacking another player or being attacked by another Player (PvP), or through Travel when failing to defeat a Travel NPC.

<h1> Hitpoints | Recovering HP </h1> 

The player can recover their HP in 5 different ways.

This may include:
- The use of Food.
- Diamonds to Refill HP.
- Regeneration over time (5% per 5 minutes, 10% per 5 minutes if pleb).
- Folen's Tent.
- Leveling up to recover full health.
