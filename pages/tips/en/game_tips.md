Tips | How do I play?

Fellow Simpletopians! Here are a few tips on how to start playing SimpleMMO.

. Gain Experience by Travelling, Questing, doing Jobs and Tasks, and fighting Battles! 
 -> Use your energy points to fight NPCS and your quest points to do Quests. 

. Invest your stat points on Strength and Dexterity, 2:1 ratio. You should stop adding points to Dexterity when you have reached the maximum needed for completing the current last quest, currently 6,720. You can earn stat points by leveling up. 

. Try not to Gamble early on. Save your gold in your Bank for the future.

. Turning on Safe Mode can help avoid being attacked by other players.
 -> Permanent safe mode will be automatically activated upon reaching level 200, you will be able to turn it off once for free.

. You can heal for free 3 times per day (6 if you are a pleb) in Folen's Tent. In addition, you can regenerate Health by Food or simply over time at a rate of 5% HP per 5 minutes. (10% HP per 5 minutes if you are a pleb).

. Do not beg anywhere for gold or items. It does not work, and frequently results in negative reputation. Not only that, but it's against the rules!

. Try not to spend your gold on items in the Player Market at a low level, as you will quickly find out that they are inferior to higher-level items that you find later on for free.

. BANK YOUR EXCESS GOLD. This will prevent you from losing a chunk of it if you are killed by another player.

. Select a job as soon as possible. You get permanent stat bonuses from your current job and rank within it. See Jobs for more information.


. If you are idling, calculate the time it takes to regenerate both energy and quest points (50 Minutes if you haven't bought any more with Diamonds), and set your Jobs to that time and turn push notifications on so you are alerted when your job is complete. This will help you be as efficient as you can be whilst idling.
